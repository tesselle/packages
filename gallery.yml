  title: Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization
  version: 1.14.0
  description: |-
    Color schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative,
    diverging or sequential), with colors that are distinct for all
    people, including color-blind readers. This package provides an
    implementation of Paul Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018)
    <doi:10.5194/gmd-11-2541-2018> color schemes for use with
    'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate
    color-blindness and to test how well the colors of any palette
    are identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic
    timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.

  title: Analysis and Visualization of Archaeological Count Data
  version: 3.1.1
  description: |-
    An easy way to examine archaeological count data. This
    package provides several tests and measures of diversity:
    heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.),
    richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.),
    turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). It allows to
    easily visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank vs
    abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977)
    diagrams, etc.

    Analysis of Chronological Patterns from Archaeological Count
    Data
  version: 2.1.1
  description: |-
    A toolkit for absolute and relative dating and analysis of
    chronological patterns. This package includes functions for
    chronological modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages
    from count data. It provides methods for matrix seriation. It
    also allows to compute time point estimates and density
    estimates of the occupation and duration of an archaeological
    site.

  title: Datasets for Teaching Archaeology and Paleontology
  version: 1.5.0
  description: |-
    Datasets for teaching quantitative approaches and modeling
    in archaeology and paleontology. This package provides several
    types of data related to broad topics (cultural evolution,
    radiocarbon dating, paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used
    to illustrate statistical methods in the classroom
    (multivariate data analysis, compositional data analysis,
    diversity measurement, etc.).

    Correspondence Analysis (CA) based on the Singular Value
    Decomposition (SVD). This package provides S4 classes and
    methods to compute, extract, summarize and visualize results of
    multivariate data analysis. It also includes methods for
    partial bootstrap validation described in Greenacre (1984,
    ISBN: 978-0-12-299050-2) and Lebart et al. (2006, ISBN:
    978-2-10-049616-7).

  description: |-
    A dependency-free collection of simple functions for
    cleaning rectangular data. This package allows to detect, count
    and replace values or discard rows/columns using a predicate
    function. In addition, it provides tools to check conditions
    and return informative error messages.

  title: Archaeological Time Series
  version: 1.0.4
  description: |-
    A toolkit for archaeological time series. This package
    provides a system of classes and methods to represent and work
    with archaeological time series. Dates are represented as "rata
    die" and can be converted to (virtually) any calendar defined
    by Reingold and Dershowitz (2018) <doi:10.1017/9781107415058>.
    This packages offers a simple API that can be used by other
    specialized packages.

  title: Ternary Plots
  version: 1.2.0
  description: |-
    Ternary plots made simple. This package allows to create
    ternary plots using 'graphics'. It provides functions to
    display the data in the ternary space, to add or tune graphical
    elements and to display statistical summaries. It also includes
    common ternary diagrams which are useful for the archaeologist
    (e.g. soil texture charts, ceramic phase diagram).

  title: Easily Install and Load 'tesselle' Packages
  version: 1.4.0
  description: |-
    Easy install and load key packages from the 'tesselle'
    suite in a single step. The 'tesselle' suite is a collection of
    packages for research and teaching in archaeology. These
    packages focus on quantitative analysis methods developed for
    archaeology. The 'tesselle' packages are designed to work
    seamlessly together and to complement general-purpose and other
    specialized statistical packages. These packages can be used to
    explore and analyze common data types in archaeology: count
    data, compositional data and chronological data. Learn more
