      subtitle: Analysis and Visualization of Archaeological Count Data
      description: |
        **tabula** provides
        several tests and measures of diversity: heterogeneity and evenness
        (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1,
        Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson,
        etc.). The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical
        thresholds: rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford and Bertin diagrams.

      subtitle: Sourcing Archaeological Materials by Chemical Composition
      description: |
        **nexus** allows the exploration and analysis of compositional data in the
        framework of Aitchison (1986). It provides tools for chemical
        fingerprinting and source tracking of ancient materials.
        **Initial development is in progress.**

      subtitle: Analysis of Chronological Patterns from Archaeological Count Data
      description: |
        A toolkit for absolute dating and analysis of chronological patterns.
        This package includes functions for chronological modeling and dating of
        archaeological assemblages from count data. It provides methods for
        matrix seriation. It also allows to compute time point estimates and
        density estimates of the occupation and duration of an archaeological
        site.
    - title: aion
      subtitle: Archaeological Time Series
      description: |
        A toolkit for archaeological time series analysis. This package provides
        a system of classes and methods to represent and work with
        archaeological time series. Dates are represented as *rata die* and can
        be converted to (virtualy) any calendar defined by Reingold (2018).

      subtitle: Multivariate Data Analysis
      description: |
        Simple Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis
        (CA) based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This package
        provides S4 classes and methods to compute, extract, summarize and
        visualize results of multivariate data analysis. It also includes
        methods for partial bootstrap validation described in Greenacre (1984)
        and Lebart (2006).

      subtitle: Ternary Plots
      description: |
        This package allows to create ternary plot
        using `graphics`. It provides functions to display the data in the
        ternary space, to add or tune graphical elements and to display
        statistical summaries. It also includes common ternary diagrams useful
        for the archaeologist (e.g. soil texture charts, ceramic phase diagram).
    - title: khroma
      subtitle: Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization
      description: |
        Colour schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or
        sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people, including
        colour-blind readers. This package provides an implementation of Paul
        Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018) colour schemes for use with
        `graphics` or `ggplot2`. It provides tools to simulate colour-blindness
        and to test how well the colours of any palette are identifiable.
        Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover,
        FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.

      subtitle: Pre-Processing XY Data from Experimental Methods
      description: |
        A lightweight, dependency-free toolbox for pre-processing XY data from
        experimental methods (i.e. any signal that can be measured along a
        continuous variable). This package provides methods for baseline
        estimation and correction, smoothing, normalization, integration and
        peaks detection.
    - title: arkhe
      subtitle: Tools for Cleaning Rectangular Data
      description: |
        This
        package allows to detect, count and replace values or delete
        rows/columns according to a specific predicate. In addition, it provides
        tools to check conditions and return informative error messages.

      subtitle: Datasets for Teaching Archaeology and Paleontology
      description: |
        **folio** provides several types of data
        related to broad topics (cultural evolution, radiocarbon dating,
        paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used to illustrate statistical
        methods in the classroom (multivariate data analysis, compositional
        data analysis, diversity measurement, etc.).
