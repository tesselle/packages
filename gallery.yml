- title: tabula
  subtitle: Analysis and Visualization of Archaeological Count Data
  categories:
    - count data
  description: |
    'tabula' provides several tests and measures of diversity: heterogeneity and
    evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction
    (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson,
    etc.). The package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical
    thresholds: rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford and Bertin diagrams.
- title: nexus
  subtitle: Sourcing Archaeological Materials by Chemical Composition
  categories:
    - compositional data
  description: |
    'nexus' allows the exploration and analysis of compositional data in the
    framework of Aitchison (1986). It provides tools for chemical
    fingerprinting and source tracking of ancient materials.
- title: kairos
  subtitle: Analysis of Chronological Patterns from Archaeological Count Data
  categories:
    - count data
    - chronological data
  description: |
    'kairos' includes functions for chronological modeling and dating of
    archaeological assemblages from count data. It provides methods for
    matrix seriation. It also allows to compute time point estimates and
    density estimates of the occupation and duration of an archaeological
    site.
- title: aion
  subtitle: Archaeological Time Series
  categories:
    - chronological data
  description: |
    'aion' provides a system of classes and methods to represent and work with
    archaeological time series. Dates are represented as rata die and can
    be converted to (virtualy) any calendar defined by Reingold (2018).
- title: dimensio
  subtitle: Multivariate Data Analysis
  categories:
    - multivariate data analysis
  description: |
    Simple Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis
    (CA) based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 'dimensio'
    provides S4 classes and methods to compute, extract, summarize and
    visualize results of multivariate data analysis. It also includes
    methods for partial bootstrap validation described in Greenacre (1984)
    and Lebart (2006).
- title: isopleuros
  subtitle: Ternary Plots
  categories:
    - data visualization
  description: |
    'isopleuros' allows to create ternary plot using 'graphics'. It provides
    functions to display the data in the ternary space, to add or tune graphical
    elements and to display statistical summaries. It also includes common
    ternary diagrams useful for the archaeologist (e.g. soil texture charts,
    ceramic phase diagram).
- title: khroma
  subtitle: Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization
  categories:
    - data visualization
  description: |
    Colour schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or
    sequential), with colours that are distinct for all people, including
    colour-blind readers. 'khroma' provides an implementation of Paul
    Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018) colour schemes for use with
    'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate colour-blindness
    and to test how well the colours of any palette are identifiable.
    Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover,
    FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.
- title: alkahest
  subtitle: Pre-Processing XY Data from Experimental Methods
  categories:
    - tools
  description: |
    'alkahest' is a lightweight, dependency-free toolbox for pre-processing XY
    data from experimental methods (i.e. any signal that can be measured along a
    continuous variable). This package provides methods for baseline
    estimation and correction, smoothing, normalization, integration and
    peaks detection.
- title: folio
  subtitle: Datasets for Teaching Archaeology and Paleontology
  categories:
    - datasets
  description: |
    'folio' provides several types of data related to broad topics (cultural
    evolution, radiocarbon dating, paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used
    to illustrate statistical methods in the classroom (multivariate data
    analysis, compositional data analysis, diversity measurement, etc.).
