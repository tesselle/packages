"5","khroma","Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization","1.14.0","Color schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative,
diverging or sequential), with colors that are distinct for all
people, including color-blind readers. This package provides an
implementation of Paul Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018)
<doi:10.5194/gmd-11-2541-2018> color schemes for use with
'graphics' or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate
color-blindness and to test how well the colors of any palette
are identifiable. Several scientific thematic schemes (geologic
timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are also implemented.",201,8,0
"1","tabula","Analysis and Visualization of Archaeological Count Data","3.1.1","An easy way to examine archaeological count data. This
package provides several tests and measures of diversity:
heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.),
richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.),
turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). It allows to
easily visualize count data and statistical thresholds: rank vs
abundance plots, heatmaps, Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977)
diagrams, etc.",35,5,0
"9","kairos","Analysis of Chronological Patterns from Archaeological Count
Data","2.1.1","A toolkit for absolute and relative dating and analysis of
chronological patterns. This package includes functions for
chronological modeling and dating of archaeological assemblages
from count data. It provides methods for matrix seriation. It
also allows to compute time point estimates and density
estimates of the occupation and duration of an archaeological
site.",15,1,7
"4","folio","Datasets for Teaching Archaeology and Paleontology","1.5.0","Datasets for teaching quantitative approaches and modeling
in archaeology and paleontology. This package provides several
types of data related to broad topics (cultural evolution,
radiocarbon dating, paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used
to illustrate statistical methods in the classroom
(multivariate data analysis, compositional data analysis,
diversity measurement, etc.).",13,0,0
"6","dimensio","Multivariate Data Analysis","0.9.0","Simple Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and (Multiple)
Correspondence Analysis (CA) based on the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). This package provides S4 classes and
methods to compute, extract, summarize and visualize results of
multivariate data analysis. It also includes methods for
partial bootstrap validation described in Greenacre (1984,
ISBN: 978-0-12-299050-2) and Lebart et al. (2006, ISBN:
978-2-10-049616-7).",10,0,1
"8","arkhe","Tools for Cleaning Rectangular Data","1.7.0","A dependency-free collection of simple functions for
cleaning rectangular data. This package allows to detect, count
and replace values or discard rows/columns using a predicate
function. In addition, it provides tools to check conditions
and return informative error messages.",10,0,0
"10","aion","Archaeological Time Series","1.0.4","A toolkit for archaeological time series. This package
provides a system of classes and methods to represent and work
with archaeological time series. Dates are represented as ""rata
die"" and can be converted to (virtually) any calendar defined
by Reingold and Dershowitz (2018) <doi:10.1017/9781107415058>.
This packages offers a simple API that can be used by other
specialized packages.",10,0,1
"12","isopleuros","Ternary Plots","1.2.0","Ternary plots made simple. This package allows to create
ternary plots using 'graphics'. It provides functions to
display the data in the ternary space, to add or tune graphical
elements and to display statistical summaries. It also includes
common ternary diagrams which are useful for the archaeologist
(e.g. soil texture charts, ceramic phase diagram).",9,1,0
"13","tesselle","Easily Install and Load 'tesselle' Packages","1.4.0","Easy install and load key packages from the 'tesselle'
suite in a single step. The 'tesselle' suite is a collection of
packages for research and teaching in archaeology. These
packages focus on quantitative analysis methods developed for
archaeology. The 'tesselle' packages are designed to work
seamlessly together and to complement general-purpose and other
specialized statistical packages. These packages can be used to
explore and analyze common data types in archaeology: count
data, compositional data and chronological data. Learn more
about 'tesselle' at <https://www.tesselle.org>.",7,0,0
"3","nexus","Sourcing Archaeological Materials by Chemical Composition","0.3.0.9000","Exploration and analysis of compositional data in the
framework of Aitchison (1986, ISBN: 978-94-010-8324-9). This
package provides tools for chemical fingerprinting and source
tracking of ancient materials.",5,0,1
"11","alkahest","Pre-Processing XY Data from Experimental Methods","1.2.0","A lightweight, dependency-free toolbox for pre-processing
XY data from experimental methods (i.e. any signal that can be
measured along a continuous variable). This package provides
methods for baseline estimation and correction, smoothing,
normalization, integration and peaks detection. Baseline
correction methods includes polynomial fitting as described in
